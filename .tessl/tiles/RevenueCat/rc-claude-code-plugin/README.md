# RevenueCat AI Toolkit

Configure RevenueCat projects, products, entitlements, and offerings directly from your AI coding assistant. Access data about your revenue, conversion funnel, and experiments. Manage your in-app purchase monetization without leaving your agent. Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, Visual Studio Code, and Gemini CLI**.

The AI toolkit is distributed as a marketplace (containing a single plugin) for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Visual Studio, and as an extension for Gemini.

## Installation

### Claude Code CLI

From within Claude Code

```
/plugin 
```
Then select `Marketplace`, `+ Add Marketplace`, enter `RevenueCat/ai-toolkit`. Then, select the `RevenueCat` plugin.

Or from the command line:

```
claude plugins marketplace add RevenueCat/ai-toolkit
claude plugins install RevenueCat
```


### Cursor

Coming soon. In the meantime, you can [add the RevenueCat MCP directly](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/mcp/setup#using-with-cursor).

### OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add RevenueCat/ai-toolkit
```

Start Codex, then run `/plugins`, search for `RevenueCat`, and install.


### OpenAI Codex Desktop App

First, install the marketplace by running the following command in your terminal:

```
codex plugin marketplace add RevenueCat/ai-toolkit
```

Then, in the Codex app, click on "Plugins". From the "Built by OpenAI" dropdown, select "RevenueCat". Then, click the Plus button next to the plugin.


### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/RevenueCat/ai-toolkit
```


### Visual Studio Code

Plugin marketplace support is currently in beta in Visual Studio Code. Refer to the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-plugins#_configure-plugin-marketplaces) for how to add this repo as a plugin marketplace, then install the plugin from the marketplace.


### Other (unsupported agentic coding environments)
Use `npx skills`:

```
npx skills add RevenueCat/ai-toolkit
```

Note that this will only install the skills from this repository, not the MCP server. Configure the MCP manually in your coding environment [following our instructions](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/mcp/setup).

## Authentication

The plugin requires authentication with your RevenueCat account via OAuth.

Depending on the environment, you might get prompted to authenticate immediately, when you first use a RevenueCat tool, or manually (in Gemini: `/mcp auth revenuecat`). Authentication happens via OAuth in your browser. This grants access based on your RevenueCat account permissions and covers all your projects.
